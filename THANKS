Thanks to:

   Joost van Baal
      author of the build environment.

   Stefan Kamphausen
      for writing cdargs which begat apparix.

   Sitaram Chamarty
      contributed the bash completion mechanism for apparix.  It was first
      modelled after the cdargs equivalent, but then took on a life of its own
      as it acquired completion on subdirectory names of the bookmark target.
