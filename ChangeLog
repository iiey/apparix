   *  apparix-11-062 released.

   *  The option -pick was added to support the new bash function 'whence'.


Wed 26 Nov 2008

   *  apparix-08-331 released.

   *  The bash completion code was changed to improve tab completion on
      subdirectories of the mark.  First, a bug was fixed where this completion
      would include subdirectories of the current directory. Second,
      patterns with no matching subdirectories will never generate an error
      but simply stall completion, utilizing the bash nullglob option.

   *  Fixed a bug in the string library - unlikely to affect apparix.


Thu 24 Jul 2008

   *  apparix-08-206 released.

   *  The apparix function 'to' can now be used as a drop-in replacement
      for cd.

   *  Apparix and its wrappers have been expanded so that they act as
      a replacement for cd in cases where the mark is not a bookmark but
      exists as an accessible directory.  Bash tab completion acts by default
      transparently and simultaneously on both bookmarks and accessible
      directories.

   *  Added options --try-current-first and --try-current-last.  These can be
      used in the 'to' definition, instructing apparix to check whether the
      mark is also the name of an accessible directory.  The definitions of
      'to' as shipped with apparix do this, using --try-current-first.

   *  Added option --tell-current. This will notify the user if an entry was
      found as a regular directory rather than via bookmark lookup. Only
      meaningful in conjunction with one of the options above.

Tue 18 Sep 2007

   *  apparix-07-261 released.

   *  --squash-mark and --squash-dest have gone. They are now replaced
      by -sm <mark> and -sd <mark>.  Squashing can no longer be applied
      globally but must be targeted at a specific bookmark or its destination.
      This is more in line with expected use. See further below.

   *  apparix -sd MARK squashes all the *other* marks that point to the
      destination bookmarked under MARK. Only MARK is kept for this
      destination.

   *  apparix -ld MARK lists all bookmarks MARK (noting that the same bookmark
      is allowed to point to multiple locations) and additionally lists all
      other bookmarks that share the destination with one of the MARK
      bookmarks. This allows one to predict the effect of issuing 'apparix -sd
      MARK'.

   *  apparix -sm MARK squashes all the distinct destinations under the same
      bookmark MARK.  By default the last destination is taken.

   *  apparix -lm MARK lists all the distinct destinations under the same
      bookmark MARK.

   *  Apparix squash and purge options now output the dumped bookmarks
      as command-line statements ready to reimport, rather than the format
      used in the apparix rc file. A cut and paste will reinstate unwanted
      removals. Set APPARIXPURGE to 1 to have dumped bookmarks in
      the apparixrc file format.

   *  The environment variable APPARIXTAG, if set, is incorporated
      into the names of the apparix resource files. By default these are
      .apparixrc and .apparixexpand. When APPARIXTAG is set to <tag>
      they become .<tag>apparixrc and .<tag>apparixexpand.

      This can be used e.g. to have different resource files on different
      host machines.

   *  If the environment APPARIXLOG is set its value is interpreted as a log
      file that has all newly created jumps and portals appended to it.

Wed 3 Jul 2007

   *  apparix-07-184 released.

   *  Apparix is now licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3.

   *  Added --quiet-jump option. By default apparix will emit an error
      message and set the exit status to 1 when looking up a mark and not
      finding it. With this option, it is silent. It will still exit
      with status 1.

   *  For portal expansion apparix would exclude the destination 'CVS',
      and this was hardcoded.  Exclusion behaviour is now specified using the
      environment variable APPARIXEXCLUDE. This variable has the following
      syntax:

      <[:,][<string>]>+

      That is, a list of names with each name preceded by a colon or a comma.
      A colon indicates that <string> triggers exclusion of directory names
      for which the trailing component is identical to <string>.
      A comma indicates that <string> triggers exclusion of directory names
      for which the trailing component contains <string> as a substring.
      Example:
            export APPARIXEXCLUDE=:CVS:lib,tmp
      Curiosity:
            export APPARIXEXCLUDE=,

      will exclude everything from expansion, as it specifies the empty
      string.

Fri 10 Nov 2006

   *  apparix-06-314 released.

   *  Fixed Yet Another Bug that Boggles the Mind. In the last two releases
      bookmarks could not be added at all, due to the addition of a status
      check that triggers an erroneous status initialization.
      This was a bad month.

Wed  8 Nov 2006

   *  apparix-06-312 released.

   *  Fix dumb realloc-related apparix crash (n_old and n_new were in
      the wrong order) that manifests itself with bookmark nr 100.

Fri 20 Oct 2006

   *  apparix-06-293 released.

   *  Fix dumb apparix crash when .apparixrc is not present.
      (This bug would occur only once as apparix created .apparixrc
      before crashing).

   *  Warn when commas are found in mark or target.

Tue 23 May 2006

   *  apparix-06-142 released.

   *  --squash-mark was badly implemented and would generally not work. It now
      works and preserves newer entries (those occurring later in the file
      .apparixrc) over older entries by default. To change this behaviour use
      -favour <mode>.

   *  If a new bookmark already exists either as a regular bookmark or
      as a portal destination apparix will emit a short message when the
      bookmark is created.

   *  Added -l option for paragraph listing of all available jumps.

   *  Added -d option for dumping the resource file to STDOUT.

   *  Added -u <num> option for undoing the last k bookmarks.

   *  The -favour default in to() functions/macros is set to rOl, implying:
         1) regular bookmarks are prefered over expansions
         2) younger bookmarks are prefered over older bookmarks
         3) paths with fewer components are prefered.
      With this setting 3) is never reached as 2) will never be a tie.

   *  Added alias -sm for -squash-mark

   *  The -favour default with --squash-mark and -sm
      is set to Olr implying that younger bookmarks will be preserved.

   *  Squashing and purging currently only works on regular style bookmarks
      due to finally specified semantics. Edit .apparixrc to do things
      to portals. They are 'special' and quite likely you have only few.

   *  The output format when simply listing bookmarks has slightly changed.
      There are now three consecutive sections: portals, expansions,
      bookmarks.

   *  --add-portal uses the same getcwd/pwd code as --add-jump does
      (rather than unconditionally using getcwd).

   *  Changed -rid to -purge, -rid-mark to -purge-mark.

Thu 5 Jan 2006

   *  apparix-06-005 released.

   *  Documentation changes. Added GETTING STARTED paragraph.

Thu, 10 Nov 2005

   *  apparix-05-314 released - major new features.

   *  NOTE
      It is necessary to update your functions or aliases; issue apparix
      --shell-examples to find the up-to-date default versions.

   *  Integrated bash completion code contributed by Sitaram Chamarty.
      It is now possible to tab-complete on subdirectories of the directory
      identified by a mark. Thus

         to myfoo <TAB>

      will give you a menu of or cycle through the subdirectories of
      the myfoo target directory, depending on your completion settings.
      It is also possible to do

         to myfoo PAT<TAB>

      This will only select those subdirectories that match the shell-pattern
      PAT. As a reminder,

         to <TAB>
         to PAT<TAB>

      do the same but then on apparix bookmarks.

   *  The to() function/alias reads its input directly from apparix without
      requiring an intermediate file. So .apparixresult is no longer created.

   *  Fixed stupid copy-code bug in bash bm() and portal(). They would initiate
      a jump.

   *  The -quo / --quo options were dropped. Simply use apparix without
      arguments to get the list of bookmarks.

   *  added -favour <list> option to resolve duplicate bookmarks.
      It is needed in the bash completion code.
      Typical usage (in the wrapper functions): -favour lro
         l  level (shorter paths prefered)
         r  regular bookmarks prefered (not expansions)
         o  older bookmarks prefered
      LRO do the opposite.

   *  Added --bu and -bu <fname> backup options.

   *  Significant documentation updates.

Wed, 2 Nov 2005

   *  apparix-05-306 released.

   *  apparix --add-jump without any arguments will take the trailing component
      of the current directory as the bookmark, with the directory itself as
      the destination.

      With the shorthand alias/function bm that means simply entering
         bm
      does the trick.

   *  The bash to() function was wrongly documented. It would not pass through
      subdirectory specification. Now updated.

   *  added -v option to show version information.

   *  more documentation.

Mon, 10 Oct 2005

   *  apparix-05-283 released

   *  initial release.
