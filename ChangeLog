   *  apparix-05-314 released - major new features.

   *  NOTE
      It is necessary to update your functions or aliases; issue apparix
      --shell-examples to find the up-to-date default versions.

   *  Integrated bash completion code contributed by Sitaram Chamarty.
      It is now possible to tab-complete on subdirectories of the directory
      identified by a mark. Thus

         to myfoo <TAB>

      will give you a menu of or cycle through the subdirectories of
      the myfoo target directory, depending on your completion settings.
      It is also possible to do

         to myfoo PAT<TAB>

      This will only select those subdirectories that match the shell-pattern
      PAT. As a reminder,

         to <TAB>
         to PAT<TAB>

      do the same but then on apparix bookmarks.

   *  The to() function/alias reads its input directly from apparix without
      requiring an intermediate file. So .apparixresult is no longer created.

   *  Fixed stupid copy-code bug in bash bm() and portal(). They would initiate
      a jump.

   *  The -quo / --quo options were dropped. Simply use apparix without
      arguments to get the list of bookmarks.

   *  added -favour <list> option to resolve duplicate bookmarks.
      It is needed in the bash completion code.
      Typical usage (in the wrapper functions): -favour lro
         l  level (shorter paths prefered)
         r  regular bookmarks prefered (not expansions)
         o  older bookmarks prefered
      LRO do the opposite.

   *  Added --bu and -bu <fname> backup options.

   *  Significant documentation updates.

   *  apparix-05-306 released.

   *  apparix --add-jump without any arguments will take the trailing component
      of the current directory as the bookmark, with the directory itself as
      the destination.

      With the shorthand alias/function bm that means simply entering
         bm
      does the trick.

   *  The bash to() function was wrongly documented. It would not pass through
      subdirectory specification. Now updated.

   *  added -v option to show version information.

   *  more documentation.
