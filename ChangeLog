   *  apparix-06-142 released.

   *  --squash-mark was badly implemented and would generally not work. It now
      works and preserves newer entries (those occurring later in the file
      .apparixrc) over older entries by default. To change this behaviour use
      -favour <mode>.

   *  If a new bookmark already exists either as a regular bookmark or
      as a portal destination apparix will emit a short message when the
      bookmark is created.

   *  Added -l option for paragraph listing of all available jumps.

   *  Added -d option for dumping the resource file to STDOUT.

   *  Added -u <num> option for undoing the last k bookmarks.

   *  The -favour default in to() functions/macros is set to rOl, implying:
         1) regular bookmarks are prefered over expansions
         2) younger bookmarks are prefered over older bookmarks
         3) paths with fewer components are prefered.
      With this setting 3) is never reached as 2) will never be a tie.

   *  Added alias -sm for -squash-mark

   *  The -favour default with --squash-mark and -sm
      is set to Olr implying that younger bookmarks will be preserved.

   *  Squashing and purging currently only works on regular style bookmarks
      due to finally specified semantics. Edit .apparixrc to do things
      to portals. They are 'special' and quite likely you have only few.

   *  The output format when simply listing bookmarks has slightly changed.
      There are now three consecutive sections: portals, expansions,
      bookmarks.

   *  --add-portal uses the same getcwd/pwd code as --add-jump does
      (rather than unconditionally using getcwd).

   *  Changed -rid to -purge, -rid-mark to -purge-mark.

   *  apparix-06-005 released.

   *  Documentation changes. Added GETTING STARTED paragraph.

   *  apparix-05-314 released - major new features.

   *  NOTE
      It is necessary to update your functions or aliases; issue apparix
      --shell-examples to find the up-to-date default versions.

   *  Integrated bash completion code contributed by Sitaram Chamarty.
      It is now possible to tab-complete on subdirectories of the directory
      identified by a mark. Thus

         to myfoo <TAB>

      will give you a menu of or cycle through the subdirectories of
      the myfoo target directory, depending on your completion settings.
      It is also possible to do

         to myfoo PAT<TAB>

      This will only select those subdirectories that match the shell-pattern
      PAT. As a reminder,

         to <TAB>
         to PAT<TAB>

      do the same but then on apparix bookmarks.

   *  The to() function/alias reads its input directly from apparix without
      requiring an intermediate file. So .apparixresult is no longer created.

   *  Fixed stupid copy-code bug in bash bm() and portal(). They would initiate
      a jump.

   *  The -quo / --quo options were dropped. Simply use apparix without
      arguments to get the list of bookmarks.

   *  added -favour <list> option to resolve duplicate bookmarks.
      It is needed in the bash completion code.
      Typical usage (in the wrapper functions): -favour lro
         l  level (shorter paths prefered)
         r  regular bookmarks prefered (not expansions)
         o  older bookmarks prefered
      LRO do the opposite.

   *  Added --bu and -bu <fname> backup options.

   *  Significant documentation updates.

Wed, 2 Nov 2005

   *  apparix-05-306 released.

   *  apparix --add-jump without any arguments will take the trailing component
      of the current directory as the bookmark, with the directory itself as
      the destination.

      With the shorthand alias/function bm that means simply entering
         bm
      does the trick.

   *  The bash to() function was wrongly documented. It would not pass through
      subdirectory specification. Now updated.

   *  added -v option to show version information.

   *  more documentation.

   *  apparix-05-283 released
