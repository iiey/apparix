   *  apparix-05-306 released.

   *  apparix --add-jump without any arguments will take the trailing component
      of the current directory as the bookmark, with the directory itself as
      the destination.

      With the shorthand alias/function bm that means simply entering
         bm
      does the trick.

   *  The bash to() function was wrongly documented. It would not pass through
      subdirectory specification. Now updated.

   *  added -v option to show version information.

   *  more documentation.
