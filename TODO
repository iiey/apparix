-  issuing --add-mark should take the trailing component of the path
   as the bookmark.

?
-? option where regular bookmarks are prefered over expansion bookmarks.

-  for a portal, optionally add a bookmark for the portal itself?
   could do this with a two-argument invocation.

-  when a subdirectory is given it could be used to resolve
   multiple hits.

#  make a mode (maybe -a) to simply list all matching occurrences
   without going into the menue if multiple matches.

   hum ho, that's what grep is for.


?  if no exact match, make menu for strstr occurrences.
      (e.g. strcmp/strstr callback to attempt_jump)

?  do not write trailing '\n' if stdout is not a terminal.
   enable vi `apparix foo`/Makefile.am
   except that this does not work with multiple matches.
   could kludge by checking for isatty(fileno(stdout)) ..

-   clean up all the bookmark_* that don't return (close IO)

   clean up all the dies to close IO etc.
<?
   add xf to fl as a member, so routines can close it.
   provide CLOSE_XF argument to bookmark routines.

?  -quo t  (show all marks)
   -quo e  (show all portals)
   -quo a  (show all marks + expansions)

-  analysis/warning modes for duplicates etc.
