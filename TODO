$$ when a subdirectory is given it could be used to resolve
   multiple hits.
-> with duplicates completion works due to -favour, but then apparix 
   asks which directory you want anyway.

-  warn when a new bm is a duplicate, either in mark or in dest.

?  exclusion line in apparix.rc; specify certain names not
   to expand; eg src CVS etc.



?  change to tab separated resource files.

?  option --rename-tag foo bar
   |
-  make separate routine that lists a number of choices and
   returns a number.

?  for a portal, optionally add a bookmark for the portal itself?
   could do this with a two-argument invocation.

#  make a mode (maybe -a) to simply list all matching occurrences
   without going into the menu if multiple matches.
   hum ho, that's what grep is for.

   note that simply 'apparix' lists all the bookmarks.

#  if no exact match, make menu for strstr occurrences.
      (e.g. strcmp/strstr callback to attempt_jump)
   bash tab completion does this nicely.

?  do not write trailing '\n' if stdout is not a terminal.
   enable vi `apparix foo`/Makefile.am
   via function/alias using -favour.
