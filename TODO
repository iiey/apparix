$  change to tab separated resource files.

-  make backup mechanism where date tag is automatically added.

-  [src] it would be neater to have the shell examples in a separate file
   and have code that incorporates it into the C source (a la clmformat).

-  enable sorting with 'apparix -l', 'apparix', possibly 'apparix -d'

-  sorting for jumping can first grep the bookmark into a mini-folder.

?  when a subdirectory is given it could be used to resolve
   multiple hits (bit too fancy though).

?  portal: option to prepend prefix to all bookmarks.
   This would require change of rc format (because of rehashing)

?  for a portal, optionally add a bookmark for the portal itself.
   could do this with a two-argument invocation.

#  read from $APPARIXRC (to support different file systems / machines)

#  make a mode (maybe -a) to simply list all matching occurrences
   without going into the menu if multiple matches.
   hum ho, that's what grep is for.

   note that simply 'apparix' lists all the bookmarks.

#  if no exact match, make menu for strstr occurrences.
      (e.g. strcmp/strstr callback to attempt_jump)
   bash tab completion does this nicely.

#  a 'rename' option.
   apparix -r foo bar
   difficult with duplicates: use editor.
