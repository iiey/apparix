.SH NAME
apparix \- bookmark directories and apparate inside them
.SH SYNOPSIS

Apparix allows you to bookmark directories and later jump to
them using the mark\&. When jumping, the contributed bash completion code
allows one to complete on bookmarks and on subdirectories of
the target directory\&.

Below, \fBto\fP, \fBbm\fP and \fBportal\fP are shell aliases or
functions that can be changed to have any name the user desires\&.

In the last example apparix simply shows all its bookmarks\&.
The first batch shows secondary bookmarks expanded from portals\&. The second
batch shows all primary bookmarks and portals\&.

Apparix also allows subdirectory specification\&. If this is combined
with the bash completion code it yields a powerful way of navigating
container directories, i\&.e\&. directories that contain a large number
of subdirectories\&. Refer to the \fBsubdirectory specification\fP section\&.

.SH DESCRIPTION

Apparix combines the properties of the
\fIcdargs\fP utility
and the \fBCDPATH\fP shell mechanism for fast navigation through
the file system\&. It is especially useful for visiting and documenting
both often- and rarely-used locations\&. Apparix enables you to attach marks
to locations and jump to those locations by loading the mark\&. Marking,
unmarking and jumping are simple operations that are performed in the
current shell\&. By setting up convenient aliases for marking and jumping the
file system can be navigated in a fast and intuitive manner\&.
The \fBFILES\fP section lists aliases for csh-type shells and
functions for bash, including the setup to equip the \fBto\fP function
with argument completion in bash\&.

This section contains some examples of the most common uses
of apparix\&.
\fBOPTIONS\fP contains a list of additional options available
for pruning and squashing bookmarks\&.

\fBNOTES\fP features a brief discussion of the advantages
of apparix over other approaches such as setting up aliases for
often visited directories, using symlinks, CDPATH, or a combination
of these\&. \fBHISTORY\fP explains the difference between
cdargs and apparix\&.
The sections \fBduplicate resolution\fP, \fBsubdirectory specification\fP, \fBtab completion\fP and
\fBcopying and moving files\fP
further below are also recommended reading\&.

Apparix works in a manner similar to cdargs\&. One usually invokes
apparix by using pre-defined aliases\&. Here they will be called \fBbm\fP for
bookmark, \fBportal\fP for a CDPATH-style bookmark and \fBto\fP for initiating
an apparition (aka jump)\&.
These aliases are found below in the \fBFILES\fP
section and can also be obtained by issuing

.di ZV

.nf \fC
apparix --shell-examples
.fi \fR

Suppose your user name is \fIeez\fP and your home directory is \fC/home/eez\fP\&.
You often visit a directory called
\fC/home/eez/cvs/xyz/tfa/faq/zut/bar/foo\fP\&.
This is how to create and use a bookmark for foo

.di ZV
.in 0
.nf \fC
/home/eez/cvs/xyz/tfa/faq/zut/bar/foo> \fBbm foo\fP
added: foo -> /home/eez/cvs/xyz/tfa/faq/zut/bar/foo
/home/eez/cvs/xyz/tfa/faq/zut/bar/foo> \fBcd\fP
/home/eez> \fBto foo\fP
/home/eez/cvs/xyz/tfa/faq/zut/bar/foo>
.fi \fR

.ne \n(dnu
.nf \fC

If one bookmarks a directory by its trailing component as happened in
this case, it is not necessary to specify the mark\&. By default apparix
will use the trailing component as the mark\&. So

.di ZV
.in 0
.nf \fC
/home/eez/cvs/xyz/tfa/faq/zut/bar/foo> \fBbm\fP
added: foo -> /home/eez/cvs/xyz/tfa/faq/zut/bar/foo
.fi \fR
.in
.di
.ne \n(dnu
.nf \fC
.ZV
.fi \fR

gives the same result\&.

Another scenario is where you have some directory that contains a largish
number of subdirectories, all of which you would like to have bookmarked\&.
If the subdirectories have distinctive names this can be achieved in
one fell swoop by marking the parent directory as a \fIportal\fP\&. This is
similar to adding the parent directory to the CDPATH environment variable,
except that apparix bookmarks are not part of the cd namespace\&. It is
argued in \fBNOTES\fP that this is a good thing\&.
Consider this\&.

Some of the subdirectories have not-so-distinct names such as \fIcontrib\fP and
\fIattic\fP, but they happen to be the directories least visited\&.
Issuing

.fi \fR

yields all of the subdirectories as destinations bookmarked by the last
component of their path name\&.
Note that bookmarks resulting from portal expansion are kept in a separate
resource file (see \fBFILES\fP)\&. Portal expansions can be recreated
by issuing

.di ZV
.in 0
.nf \fC

.fi \fR

.di
.ne \n(dnu
.nf \fC
.ZV
.fi \fR

This is useful to reflect a change in the directory naming structure
underneath a portal\&.
.SH duplicate resolution
Apparix allows identical bookmarks to point to different locations\&.
When asked to visit such a bookmark it will by default
present a list of options\&.

The \fB-favour\fP\ \fI<list>\fP option can be used to automate
resolution\&. \fB<list>\fP is a sequence of single characters\&.
The order in which they are given denote the order in which
resolution rules are applied\&. This option is typically used
in the definition of the \fBto\fP function/alias or
in the bash completion code\&.

.ZI 3m "l"
\fIlevel\fP; prefer paths with fewer components\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "L"
reverse of the above\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "o"
\fIbookmark order\fP; prefer older entries\&.
Entries appearing earlier in the file are considered older,
but the actual date of creating the bookmark is not stored\&.
Refer to \fBediting bookmarks\fP for more information\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "O"
reverse of the above\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "r"
\fIregular first\fP; prefer regular bookmarks over portal expansion\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "R"
reverse of the above\&.
.in -3m

If there are still ties after the specified rules have
been applied apparix will simply take the first matching
option\&. This behaviour cannot be further specified
as the program uses a non-stable ordering routine\&.

It is an absolute prerequisite that \fB-favour\fP is used in the bash
completion code\&. Otherwise completion will fail (for a duplicated bookmark)
while apparix is waiting for input\&. Refer to the tab completion description
below\&.
.SH subdirectory specification
When jumping (apparating) you can specify an additional subdirectory
after the bookmark\&. Apparix will append the subdirectory to
the destination\&.

See also the tab completion description below - it is possible
to tab-complete on subdirectories of the apparix jump directory\&.
.SH tab completion
The bash tab completion code does two things\&. First, it is possible to
tab-complete on apparix bookmarks themselves, showing a listing of all
available bookmarks (or iterating through them in cyclic mode, depending on
your bash settings)\&. Second, once a bookmark has been given tab completion
will list or iterate over all the subdirectories of the directory associated
with that bookmark\&. Specifying a string after the bookmark will limit
tab-completion to directories matching the shell-pattern in string\&.
\fIVery\fP useful\&.

Be careful to not remove the \fB-favour\fP\ \fIlist\fP option
from the bash completion code\&. It is necessary to resolve
duplicate bookmarks\&.
.SH editing bookmarks
Apparix appends new bookmarks to the end of the \&.apparixrc
file\&. Nothing stops you however from editing the file, and
this is in fact recommended if for example you need to get
rid of a bookmark and neither of \fB-rid\fP,
\fB-rid-mark\fP, \fB--squash-dest\fP,
\fB--squash-mark\fP fulfills your needs\&.
It was a deliberate and easy design choice \fInot\fP to equip
apparix with editor capabilities\&.
.SH copying and moving files
In bash it is very straightforward to copy or move files to locations known
by apparix\&. Examples:

.di ZV
.in 0
.nf \fC
   cp FOO $(apparix zoem)
   mv BAR $(apparix zoem doc)
.fi \fR
.in
.di
.ne \n(dnu
.nf \fC
.ZV
.fi \fR

.SH OPTIONS
For bookmarking and jumping apparix is best invoked by using the aliases
(tcsh-variants) or functions (sh/bash) listed in \fBFILES\fP\&.
Apparix has a few options that are useful for pruning, squashing and
rehasing bookmarks\&. These are best issued by invoking apparix directly\&.

If you are intested in marks or destinations matching a certain pattern,
simply issue apparix without arguments and pipe it through
your program of choice\&.

Options that take an argument always start with a single hyphen\&.
Unary options (those without arguments) usually start with two hyphens
except for standardized options such as \fB-h\fP\&.
Options that take an argument can be converted to a unary key=value notation,
e\&.g\&. \fB-rid-mark\fP\ \fBfoo\fP is equivalent to \fB--rid-mark\fP=\fBfoo\fP\&.

When invoked without arguments apparix will simply dump its bookmarks\&.

.ZI 3m "\fB--add-mark\fP (\fIadd jump bookmark\fP)"
\&
.br
This options expects trailing \fImark [destination]\fP argument(s)\&.
The first argument is the bookmark name\&. The optional second argument
is the target directory\&. If the target directory is not given, apparix
assumes the current directory should be bookmarked\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB--add-portal\fP (\fIadd portal bookmark\fP)"
\&
.br
This option enlists a directory as a portal and adds all subdirectories
as bookmarks\&. The name of the bookmark is simply the name of the
subdirectory\&. By default the current directory is added as a portal\&.
An optional trailing argument will override this behaviour and
instead be interpreted as the portal location\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB--squash-mark\fP (\fIsquash repeated marks\fP)"
\&
.br
Apparix will squash identical marks\&.
It does not consider the corresponding destinations and will
simply keep the last one occurring in the resource file\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB--squash-dest\fP (\fIsquash repeated destinations\fP)"
\&
.br
Apparix will squash identical destinations\&.
It does not consider the corresponding marks and will
simply keep the last one occurring in the resource file\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-rid\fP pat (\fIdelete bookmarks\fP)"
\&
.br
This deletes bookmarks where destination matches \fIpat\fP\&.
All deleted bookmarks are printed to STDOUT\&. Thus if you regret
deleting a bookmark it is easy to add it back\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-rid-mark\fP (\fIpat\fP)"
\&
.br
This deletes bookmarks where mark matches \fIpat\fP\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB--rehash\fP (\fIre-expand portal bookmarks\fP)"
\&
.br
Apparix will reread the resource file and reexpand portal
locations\&. Useful if directories have been added, renamed,
or removed\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-favour\fP <list> (\fIset duplicat resolution policy\fP)"
\&
.br
This option has its own section\&. Refer to \fBduplicate resolution\fP\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB--cwd\fP (\fIuse getcwd(3), not pwd(1)\fP)"
\&
.br
By default aparix uses the program \fIpwd\fP(1) rather than
the system call \fIgetcwd\fP(3)\&. On some systems it was found
that the latter results in paths that contain machine-specific
mount components\&.
Appparix will use \fIgetcwd\fP(3) when \fB--cwd\fP is used\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB--shell-examples\fP (\fIoutput example macros\fP)"
\&
.br
This outputs example macros\&. They are also listed in the
\fBFILES\fP section though\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB--bu\fP (\fIcreate backup of the resource file\fP)"
\&
.br
This creates the backup file in \&.apparixrc\&.bu
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "\fB-bu\fP fname (\fIcreate backup of the resource file\fP)"
\&
.br
This creates the backup file in \fIfname\fP\&.

.SH FILES

You should use aliases or functions to make apparix really useful\&.
Get them from apparix by giving it the --shell-examples option,
or from further below\&.
Note the fragment that provides \fBto\fP argument completion in bash\&.

.ZI 3m "$HOME/\&.apparixrc"
\&
.br
This is the primary resource file\&. There is usually no
need to edit it by hand\&. Sometimes it can be useful to edit
by hand to remove an unwanted bookmark; refer to \fBediting bookmarks\fP\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "$HOME/\&.apparixrc\&.bu"
\&
.br
Apparix creates a back-up file whenever it is asked to
remove entries from it\&. Refer
to \fBediting bookmarks\fP for options inducing removal\&.
You can explicitly require a backup to be made by
either of \fB--bu\fP or \fB-bu\fP\ \fIfname\fP\&.
.in -3m

.ZI 3m "$HOME/\&.apparixexpand"
\&
.br
This contains bookmarks that are expanded from portals\&.
A portal is simply some directory\&. The names of all subdirectories
are taken as bookmarks that point to those subdirectories\&.

.SH NOTES

Below follow some comments on other approaches to file system navigation\&.
\fBHISTORY\fP explains the difference between the venerable \fBcdargs\fP
program and \fBapparix\fP\&.

CDPATH is only useful in cases where a given directory has subdirectories
with distinctive names\&. It does not usually scale well when there are
more than a few paths in CDPATH\&.

Some people use aliases to jump to often visited directories\&.
I was one of them for a period of ten years\&. The fact is,
those aliases are cumbersome to create and remove and they
clutter up the alias namespace\&. They can clash with
executables when the alias includes the \fIcd\fP part\&. This sometimes
prohibits one from assigning the logical bookmark to a given
location, especially when one has a lot of source code locations
They can clash with directory names when
the aliases just expand to the location\&. This again means that
sometimes a location cannot be assigned its logical bookmark\&.
I have found that setting \fIcd\fP jumps aside in their own namespace
improves file system navigation by a large factor\&.

It is also possible to create symlinks to often
visited files\&. Again, creation and removal of these are cumbersome\&.
One could of course create shell functions with a similar interface
to apparix or cdargs to handle the symlink lifecycle\&.
On Linux Weekly News \fInix\fP suggested to put these symlinks
in a single directory and add that directory to CDPATH\&.
This is quite a neat trick and effectively creates a bookmark
navigation system\&.

Still there are problems with the above approach\&.
One problem with the symlink approach is that they are a bit
awkward to edit\&. One could make a utility to wrap around the problem,
but in the end the directory-with-symlinks would
functionally be the same as apparix\&'s \fB\&.apparixrc\fP resource file,
only more of a kludge\&.
Another problem is that symlinks are awkard when traversing
the file system\&. They confuse the notion of parent directory
and \&'\fCcd \&.\&.\fP\&' mostly does the unexpected\&. Sometimes \&'\fC\&.\&.\fP\&'
has a different meaning to \fBcd\fP than it has to another application,
as one will trace back symlinks and the other will not\&.
Finally, a minor objection
is that I find it convenient to have bookmarks in a separate
namespace than that of \fIcd\fP(1)\&. Jumps are magical and it is
natural to invoke them by a different method\&. This is in fact
how apparix acquired its CDPATH behaviour\&. I used CDPATH to
jump to a few particular source directories with distinct names
that lay deeply hidden in some CVS directory\&. Once I started using
apparix however, I would mistakenly issue \fIto\fP rather than \fIcd\fP
to jump to those locations\&. My brain classified both types of jump
in the same category\&.

Then apparix (and cdargs) have another use besides jumping, namely
annotation\&. Whenever I end up in an esoteric part of the file system and
need to make a quick note of the location, I simply bookmark it\&.

On SlashDot, that eternal source of wisdom or alternatively
the geek wheel of suffering, Clueless Moron offered the following gems\&.

.di ZV
.in 0
.nf \fC
   mk() { eval ${1:-MKPWD}=\e"\&`pwd\&`\e"; }
   rt() { eval cd \e"\e$${1:-MKPWD}\e";pwd; }

   # type "mk" (as in "mark") and "rt" (as in "return") to mark
   # a directory and later go back to it\&.
   # Or give it a name: do "mk foo", and later on "rt foo"
.fi \fR
.in
.di
.ne \n(dnu
.nf \fC
.ZV
.fi \fR

This of course is a per-session mechanism, but noteworthy
for its simplicity\&. I am not sure whether csh-style shells
could offer an equivalent\&.

A feature shared by apparix and cdargs is that adding a bookmark
immediately takes effect in all shells\&. There is no need to
source some resource file, as the applications do this everytime
they are invoked\&. It is fast, do not worry\&.
.SH BUGS
The resource file parsing code thinks that parentheses are special\&.
Also records are currently separated by commas\&.
Accordingly, apparix will hitch if a path name contains an opening parenthesis
or a comma\&.

.SH THANKS

Stefan Kamphausen wrote \fBcdargs\fP, the inspiration for apparix\&.

Sitaram Chamarty fixed up some of the existing bash code, and added the tab
completion part (basing this on similar code in cdargs)\&. He does not
garantuee predictable or even pretty results if there are spaces in the
directory names which you attempt to complete\&. \fBAUTHOR\fP would like
to submit that spaces in path names are evil, and that the completion code
seems to work in their evil presence anyway\&. Just \fIdon\&'t put
commas\fP in path names\&.

Joost van Baal wrote the apparix autotooled build environment\&.
.SH HISTORY

Apparix was created to optimize a scenario that
\fIcdargs\fP does not support
very well, namely where the mark (called \fIneedle\fP in cdargs) is always
known\&. As an additional feature apparix supports CDPATH-style behaviour and
subdirectory specification\&. In other respects apparix is a much simpler
application\&. \fBcdargs\fP offers menu-based navigation of the file system
and the bookmark list, which apparix does not\&.
